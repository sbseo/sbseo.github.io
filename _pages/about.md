I am a former graduate researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing, focusing on dynamics across multi-modalities.

I received my Master's degrees in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2021, 2022. I also worked as a software engineer intern in search query understanding at Verizon Media/Yahoo! in 2021.
