I am a results-driven graduate student in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

My experience includes theories and applications in Machine Learning, Data Science, Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, and Data Mining. Currently, I am conducting research on graph neural network in large graphs.  

I received my Master of Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2021. After that, I worked in search query understanding at Verizon Media/Yahoo! as a software engineer intern.
