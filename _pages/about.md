I am a software engineer at [Yahoo! Search](http://search.yahoo.com) query understanding team.

Before joining Yahoo, I was a graduate researcher at the [UIUC](http://illinois.edu), where I also was certified as Teacher Scholar. My research interests are **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and **information retrieval**, primarily focusing on the interaction between multi-modalities.

I received my Master's degrees in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the UIUC in 2021 and 2022.
