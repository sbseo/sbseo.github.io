I am a software engineer at Yahoo, search query understanding team. My research interests are machine learning, natural language processing, and information retrieval, primarily focusing on the interaction between multi-modalities.

Before that, I was a graduate researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I also was certified as a Teacher Scholar. I received my Master's degrees in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from UIUC in 2021 and 2022. I was awarded by the Korean government scholarship program for study abroad in the area of Artificial Intelligence.
